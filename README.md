## 👋 Hi, I'm Oliver

I rescue legacy .NET systems in manufacturing companies before they become business risks.

For 13+ years, I've specialized in making complex systems reliable again — stabilizing releases, modernizing architectures, and preparing production environments for Industry 4.0.

### What I Do

**Legacy System Stabilization**
- Transform unstable .NET systems into reliable production environments
- 60% reduction in production incidents (OPTANO case)
- 64% reduction in critical bugs through systematic refactoring

**Industry 4.0 Integration**
- OPC UA and Asset Administration Shell (AAS) implementation
- I worked at [AASX Server](https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/aasx-server)
- Fraunhofer IOSB-INA research experience in digital twins
- Creator of [FluentAAS](https://github.com/Freezor/FluentAAS) — Open-source C# library for AAS creation

**Release Excellence**
- CI/CD pipeline modernization (40% faster builds)
- Test automation (46% → 87% coverage)
- From quarterly to bi-weekly releases without downtime

### Real-World Impact

**Cross-Platform App** — Stabilized mobile app serving 300,000+ users
- 60% crash reduction within 3 months
- Enhanced release quality for enterprise-scale consumer application

**B2B Optimization Platform** — Improved analytics platform releases
- Sprint delivery reliability: 70% → 95%
- Cut deployment time by 40%
- Accelerated release cycles from quarterly to bi-weekly

### My Approach

I don't just consult — I commit code on day one and leave teams empowered to continue independently.

My work focuses on:
- Hands-on technical delivery, not PowerPoint presentations
- Measurable results over buzzwords
- Team enablement over dependency creation
- Pragmatic solutions over architectural dogma

### Technology & Domains

**Core Stack:** C# / .NET 6-9, ASP.NET Core, Docker, Microservices  
**CI/CD:** TeamCity, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps  
**Industry 4.0:** Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Digital Twins, OPC UA  
**Methodologies:** Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Continuous Delivery

### Background

Based in Lemgo, Germany (Ostwestfalen-Lippe region), with deep roots in the local manufacturing ecosystem. Previously worked at Miele, OPTANO, and Fraunhofer IOSB-INA.

### Get in Touch

If you're dealing with a legacy .NET system that's become a bottleneck, or need to integrate Industry 4.0 standards into existing production environments, let's talk.

I work with mid-sized manufacturing companies (50-500 employees) in the DACH region who need immediate technical expertise combined with long-term team development.
