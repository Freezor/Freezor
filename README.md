### Hi I'm Oliver ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working in different areas of development processes such as requirements engineering, QA, IT support and in development teams in international agile projects since 2008. I discover new things that fascinate me in technology on a daily basis, which leads to many small side projects, where I like to thinker with them.

Stuff that I'm interested in:
- ðŸ§¼ I love Clean(er) Code
- ðŸ“± Mobile application development
- ðŸŽ® Unity game development
- ðŸŽ² Dungeons & Dragons
