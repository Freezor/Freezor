## 👋 Hi, I'm Oliver

I make complex software and data landscapes manageable again.

I help companies bring structure and stability into systems that have grown too complex —
before delivery slows down, legacy code blocks progress, or unstructured data prevents scaling.

My focus is on reliability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

### What I work on

- Stabilizing software delivery and release processes
- Reducing complexity in legacy systems
- Designing testable, evolvable architectures
- Structuring and integrating data landscapes
- Implementing standards like Asset Administration Shells (AAS)

### How I think

I focus on structure over tools.

Most systems don't fail because of missing technology —
they fail because complexity becomes unmanageable.

My work is about:
- making systems understandable again
- enabling reliable delivery
- creating foundations that scale without breaking

### Technology & Domains

- C# / .NET
- Software Architecture & Refactoring
- CI/CD & Release Pipelines
- Testability & TDD
- Data Integration & Modeling
- Industry Standards (AAS / Digital Twins)

If you work with complex systems that have become hard to manage,
feel free to reach out.

I’m interested in problems where structure makes the difference.
